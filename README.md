## Objective

Effectively use Volatility for Windows Memory Analysis and Deep Blue CLI for Windows Event Log Analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Windows Memory Analysis
  - Grasp the significance of volatile memory in forensic investigations, especially for malware detection.
  - Import and analyze memory dumps to generate process lists and pinpoint suspicious processes.
  - Perform advanced memory analysis to identify process injection, malware behaviors, and network activity associated with malicious actions.

- Windows Event Log Analysis:
  - Utilize Windows Event Viewer to collect and interpret forensic data from logs, focusing on user account changes, privilege escalations, and password spraying attacks.
  - Detect and analyze encoded PowerShell commands and evasion tactics.
  - Apply Deep Blue CLI for advanced detection techniques, including PowerShell encoding and detailed EVTX file analysis.
